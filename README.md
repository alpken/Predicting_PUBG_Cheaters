CheatGuard: XGBoost-Based PUBG Cheater Detection
CheatGuard is a machine learning project designed to identify potential cheaters in PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) using XGBoost. This project aims to enhance game integrity by detecting suspicious player behavior through data analysis and predictive modeling.

Features
XGBoost Classification: Utilizes XGBoost to classify players based on their in-game behavior and statistics, identifying potential cheaters with high precision.
Data Preprocessing: Includes comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and heuristic rule application to prepare the dataset for effective modeling.
Performance Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC, with visualizations including confusion matrices and classification reports.
